address = {Stanford, CA, USA},
abstract = {Light transport algorithms generate realistic images by simulating the emission and
scattering of light in an artificial environment. Applications include lighting design,
architecture, and computer animation, while related engineering disciplines include
neutron transport and radiative heat transfer. The main challenge with these algorithms
is the high complexity of the geometric, scattering, and illumination models used.
In this dissertation, we develop new Monte Carlo techniques that greatly extend the
range of input models for which light transport simulations are practical. We start
by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for bidirectional light transport algorithms
(those that combine direct and adjoint techniques). We propose a new formulation based
on linear operators, such that for any physically valid input scene, the transport
operators are symmetric. We also show how light transport can be formulated as an
integral over a space of paths. This framework allows new sampling and integration
techniques to be applied, such as the Metropolis sampling method.Our statistical contributions
include multiple importance sampling, a new variance reduction technique that can
greatly increase the robustness of Monte Carlo integration. It uses more than one
sampling technique to evaluate an integral, and combines these samples in a way that
is provably close to optimal.Finally, we propose new Monte Carlo light transport algorithms.
Bidirectional path tracing uses a family of different path sampling techniques that
generate some path vertices starting from a light source, and some starting from a
sensor. We show that when these techniques are combined using multiple importance
sampling, a large range of difficult lighting effects can be handled efficiently.The
second algorithm we describe is Metropolis light transport, inspired by the Metropolis
sampling method from computational physics. Paths are generated by following a random
walk through path space, such that the probability density of visiting each path is
proportional the contribution it makes to the ideal image. The resulting algorithm
is unbiased, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and can be orders of magnitude
more efficient than previous unbiased approaches for difficult lighting problems.
To our knowledge, this is the first application of the Metropolis method to transport
problems of any kind.},

The parametrization preserves areas up to a constant factor and is thus very useful in the context of rendering as it allows to map random sample point sets in [0, 1]2 onto the spherical rectangle. This allows for easily incorporating stratified, quasi-Monte Carlo or other sampling strategies in algorithms that compute scattering from planar rectangular emitters.},
